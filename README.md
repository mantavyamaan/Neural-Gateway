# ATLAS Router

**Adaptive Task and LLM Allocation System** — a production-oriented LLM
routing control plane, exposed as a FastAPI service. ATLAS decides *which
model or execution plan* should handle a request, taking into account task
requirements, governance policy, runtime health, cost, latency,
uncertainty, and SLAs. It does not generate responses itself — routing is
provider-agnostic and fully separated from model execution.

This mirrors the routing pipeline described in the ATLAS design doc:

```
Request -> Artifact Inspection -> Semantic Parsing -> Task Representation
   -> Feasibility Filtering -> Policy Enforcement -> Bayesian Quality
   -> Pareto Reduction -> Utility Scoring -> Confidence Estimation
   -> Execution Plan -> Route / Escalate / Abstain
```

## Setup (VS Code / local)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional artifact-inspection libraries (`pymupdf`, `Pillow`, `openpyxl`,
`python-pptx`, `mutagen`) are in `requirements.txt` but the router degrades
gracefully if any are missing — it just falls back to prompt-keyword
heuristics for that modality. `ffprobe` (from ffmpeg) is used for
audio/video duration if present on the host `PATH`.

## Run the service

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then open **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs** for interactive Swagger docs.

## Example request

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/route \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Implement a concurrent web crawler in Python with rate limiting and structured JSON output.",
    "input_formats": ["text"],
    "estimated_tokens": 3000,
    "estimated_output_tokens": 4000,
    "profile_name": "balanced"
  }'
```

Response shape (abridged):

```json
{
  "abstain": false,
  "escalate_to_human": false,
  "selected_plan": {
    "plan_id": "...",
    "plan_type": "single_model",
    "selected_model": "GPT-5.4",
    "fallback_models": ["Claude-Sonnet-4.6", "Gemini-3-Pro"],
    "verifier_models": [],
    "expected_latency_ms": 2150.4,
    "expected_cost_usd": 0.0182,
    "confidence": 0.61
  },
  "decision_record": { "...": "full auditable trace" },
  "summary_text": "=== Atlas Router Decision === ..."
}
```

| POST   | `/outcome`       | Feed an observed outcome back into a model's Bayesian priors |

| GET    | `/models/{name}` | Full registry entry for one model |

| GET    | `/health`        | Liveness probe |

## The Model Registry (Dynamic SQLite + OpenRouter)

ATLAS uses a real-time, dynamic **SQLite database** to store its model registry, making it a production-ready routing engine.

When the application starts, `app/core/openrouter_sync.py` connects to the **OpenRouter API** to download the latest available models, their exact context window limits, and live pricing.

To ensure routing decisions are mathematically precise, it cross-references these models against `app/models/real_benchmarks.json`, which contains manually curated, **ground-truth benchmark scores** (like SWE-Bench and MMLU equivalents) for flagship models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3. 

For obscure community models that aren't mapped in our benchmark JSON, it safely falls back to heuristics generated by `app/models/registry_builder.py` so the router can still evaluate them without crashing. Tests are also run deterministically against the synthetic `registry_builder.py` data to ensure the suite is blazingly fast and works entirely offline.

## Plugging in a real semantic parser

By default, task understanding uses `fallback_structured_semantic_parse()`
(keyword heuristics) in `app/core/semantic_parser.py`. To use a real
structured-output LLM parser instead, pass an `llm_parser` callable into
`route()` — it must return a `StructuredSemanticParse` (or an equivalent
dict) and is validated via `validate_structured_parse()`. This isn't wired
into the HTTP layer by default; add it in `app/api/routes.py` where
`route()` is called.

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests mirror the original design-doc demonstration scenarios: a coding
task, a high-risk legal contract review, audio summarization, an
offensive-security policy denial, a budget-constrained support task,
long-context research with citations, and file-driven conflict detection.

## Design principles (from the spec)

1. **Hard constraints override soft preferences** — feasibility filtering
   runs before any scoring.
2. **Policy is independent of scoring** — governance never hides inside
   utility weights.
3. **Runtime conditions matter** — latency, availability, queue pressure,
   and incident status all feed into routing, not just benchmarks.
4. **Uncertainty is quantified** — Thompson Sampling estimates confidence
   rather than returning a bare point estimate.
5. **Derive signals, don't duplicate them** — everything traces back to
   the canonical registry.
6. **Every decision is reproducible** — each `RoutingDecision` carries a
   reproducibility hash plus per-subsystem version stamps.
7. **Multi-stage workflows get structured planning** — OCR, document QA,
   summarization, etc. can be routed to different specialist models within
   one plan.
